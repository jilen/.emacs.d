**ENSIME: The Next Generation** is a full rewrite of the [ENhanced Scala Interaction Mode for Emacs](https://ensime.github.io).

ENSIME runs as a compiler plugin, extracting compiler settings in a build-tool agnostic manner.

The same plugin is invoked through its command line interface from your text editor. It reads the output of the plugin to understand the dependencies and uses the Scala compiler's internal APIs to answer semantic questions.

# Features

The feature set is constrained to allow the codebase to be lean and maintainable:

- dot completion
- infer type
- import / search for class
- jump to source

# Installation

If upgrading, always delete old versions of ENSIME first

```
rm -rf ~/.cache/ensime
```

Then install the latest version with

```
sbt +install
```

from this directory and then choose to use LSP with a text editor of your choice, or an optimised Emacs-specific mode.

You may need to install additional builds for specific versions of the compiler for projects (and their project definitions) that are using an older version of the compiler, e.g.

```
sbt ++2.12.15! install
```

## LSP

### Server

Type

```
sbt lsp/install
```

from this directory and then setup the LSP for your editor.

### Client

#### VSCode

You must compile the LSP client for VSCode, which will require installing npm and typescript.

```
cd lsp/vscode
npm install
npm run package
```

Then, in VSCode, go to the Extension manager and "Install from VSIX", choosing the `.vsix` file that you just built.

## Emacs

Install the Emacs mode when enabling `scala-mode` and add your keybindings, e.g.

```lisp
(use-package ensime-mode
  :ensure nil
  :load-path "/path/to/ensime-tng/lisp"
  :commands ensime-mode
  :bind
  (:map ensime-mode-map
        ("M-." . ensime-jump-to-definition)
        ("C-c C-i t" . ensime-type-at-point)
        ("C-c C-i s" . ensime-symbol-at-point)
        ("C-c C-r i" . ensime-import-symbol-at-point)))

(add-hook 'scala-mode-hook #'ensime-mode)
```

Further steps will be provided when you start using it.

# Design

## Editor Plugin

Responsible for prompting the user to install the compiler plugin and issuing queries.

## Compiler Plugin

The plugin runs as early as possible, creating the following output:

### Launcher

For every source file a file is written into the cache containing all the information that is needed to launch the interactive compiler.

[`ng`](https://github.com/facebook/nailgun) is compiled and used so that ENSIME runs as a background server with millisecond response times. This only requires `cc` to be available.

### Local Source Lookup

For every output directory a file is written into the cache containing the list of source files that produced the binary.

## Testing

The most important tests are end-to-end regression tests. Example projects are compiled, and a series of scripted user interactions are performed on them. The output for each action is persisted as a test assertion and variations from this baseline are failures.

## Features

### Completion at Point

Requires the source file and location at point, plus (optionally) a list of all open scala files.

The location must follow a `.` since only member completions are supported.

Using the presentation compiler, find the type of the symbol preceeding the `.` and list:

- symbols (packages, methods, objects, types, etc) that live on that type
- extension methods that live on that type

returning their full scala signature, one per line.

Use of the presentation compiler follows the same time travel optimisation as ENSIME: The Original Series, in that the `target` directory is provided as a dependency to its own source. This way the presentation compiler only needs to compile source code that is being queried, not all the source files in the project. This carries the caveat that ENSIME works best when the project has been cleanly compiled recently.

This feature may be extended to work in additional positions (e.g. following keywords such as `new`, `extends`, `with`).

### Infer Type

Requires the source file and location.

Uses the presentation compiler to find the type of the symbol at point returning the fully qualified scala signature. Symbolic types having 2 type parameters are rendered infix in short form only.

### Search for Class

Requires a class name (simple name or fuzzy camel case) and an optional source file and location.

All class names that match the search are returned. Classfiles are parsed to filter out non-public and non-static classes.

If a source file and location is provided, it is used to filter entries to exclude those that are already visible at that location, which is ideal for the "import class at point" feature.

### Jump to Source

Requires the source file and location of the symbol to search (jump to source at point), or a java descriptor (jump to source of search result).

Requires that sources are downloaded manually.

Uses the presentation compiler to find the symbol at point (unless the symbol at point is the definition site, in which case we repeat for the type of the symbol at point. The symbol is then converted into a java descriptor, which allows us to look up all class files on the classpath that match the prefix of that symbol, then parse the classfile to find the source file name and line number.

Heuristics are then used to locate source directories and archives that are associated to the class directory or jar file, aided by reverse lookups produced by the compiler plugin.

All matching files from that source directory are returned, allowing the user to disambiguate identically named files. We may filter the source files based on a very simple root package name scan.
